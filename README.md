The Cal State LA Hydrogen research and fueling facility was established in the year 2014.The station is capable of producing hydrogen using renewable resources and the process involved is called as electrolysis. It is the first station to sell hydrogen fuel by kilogram into the public. In this project we have taken the data set containing the fueling details of hydrogen fuel generated in the facility and the various factors that affect the fueling process are analyzed and the prediction model is created. In this project we have used Microsoft Azure Machine learning studio to create a model for prediction, Apache spark code for analysis and creation of the spark model and Decision forest regression algorithm for prediction.
